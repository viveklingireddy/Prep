# What is Devops?  
Devops is process of improving application delivery by ensuring that there is proper   
Automation, With Proper Code quality and Ensuring  Continous Monitoring, Continous Testing takes place.  

A Devops engineer  fasten up the process of delivering the application by reducing the delivery time.  

# How does the code delivered to production before 10 years?  

-- Asusual Developer develops the code according to metrics given by customer/client.  
- Developer stores the code in *Central Repository* using Version Control System like *SVN*, *CVS* (Concurrent Version System)
- They provide the code to System Administrator --> build the code and run on server
- Tester / QA tests the application on server
- Build and Release Engineer checks application on server and promotes to next level Pre-prod/ *Stagging*
   (productionenvironment before actual release /live product stage).
- There were no cloud environments back then to deploy application by using ec2, elastic bean etc.
they run on servers like VM ware, Openstack etc.
- Everything is manual, So what happens with manual? The delivery takes time because every one needs to collabrate with each other to make it run smooth.
- So, In order to decrease the production process, Automation came into a place to fill the void of rapid delivery.
Manual Testing can be improvised by Automation Testing by giving testcases to test on applications.
