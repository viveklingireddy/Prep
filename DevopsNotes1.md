## SDLC 
- #### Software Development Life Cycle

- #### PLANNING PHASE
- In planning phase, All the documentation of Client's requirements were gathered and documented.
- #### DESIGNING PHASE
- In Design phase Architects write a HLD **(High Level Design)**, **LLD (Low Level Design)**.
- #### BUILD PHASE, TEST, DEPLOY
- These are main functionalities of DeVops Engineer, Where Automation takes place. 
- Developers develop the code, Stores it in a Repo. QA Engineers deploy on server tests on it with Unit, Integration,
   User- Acceptance testing etc. Deployment and Release to Production.
- Main Goal of Devops Engineer is to Fasten Up theese phases to Continously Deliver the Code. Automation comes into play for
  Improvising Efficiency of this phases.

- ### What is involved in the Automation then?
- In the Process of Automation many tools comes in picture such as **Jenkins** (for Building CI/CD ), Code quality check (**SonarQube**), Docker, Kubernetes (**Containers** / **Orchestration**), **Terraform** (IAC) , CodeMonitoring Tools (**Promotheus && Grafana**), etc.
-  ### PIPELINE STAGES (AWS/ CI CD)

- ## What is Server?
- In Laymen terms, Server is one who serves something, providing some service.
- Similarly, Server in Computing terms is providing something. What is it serving ?
- Serving some client required services, that is providing applications, code etc.
- Basically, Assume I'm a client(I sell Branded Clothes at my Retail Store. Now, I want to capture the market by going Remote/ Online. So, I had asked you to Build me a Website where Customers can Look at available Items in Stock and buy them
  Online. So, I get Notified about Orders.
- As Developer you should write the code, Stores it Remote Repository. So, Other team mates can contribute on it.
- Now you are done with Coding part, it is Succesfully Running at your Local. Now you should deliver it to me. How do you do it ?
- Servers can be Hardware  / Software
- Hardware  server means serving through physical components such as PC, hard disk's to client etc. Ex Game CD's etc.
- Software server are Application that (serve Piece of code/ Data bases)**host** and client connects to server through Ip 
Address and  requests for services. Each Server(Device) has its own Ip.
- Now Server comes into play. Server nows servs what ?. A pieace of code/ application/ Data over to me by what Internet.
-   

-   
-   What are fixs, bugs, down time etc.
-   Fixes are nothing but corrections, mistake removal steps. Removing erros.
-   Bugs are like errors occur due to some vunerbility, code errors that damges process, interrupt.
-   Down time is when a new version deployed got some errors/ bug at prod level. The time taken to make it to earlier stable version. / When the servers crash due to High load etc.
-   ### What is Virtual?
-   Virtual means it exists but not Physically available. 
-   Ex: Virtual Library. Here you can access to books, audio files through medium called Online. So you can read a book Online but can't have it in your hand.
-   Neo Banking: You can avail all the banking services that include transcations, Online services etc. you can physicall have a bank there.
-   ## Virtualization:
-   The process of making something have in Virtual or **Technology** that can *replicate* an existing physical infrastructure available online / Virtual. Ex: Operating Systems (Virtual Machines), Storage services(**S3** Bucket), etc.
-   ##### How to access Virtual of Any system ?
-   Any virtual version can be operated through a physical medium.
